Despite its relative proximity to civilisation, it is relatively hidden, thank to the steep descent down to the distillery from the main road as Alfred Barnard said of his visit in the 1880s: But the way is so steep, and our nerves none of the best, that we insist upon doing the remainder of the descent on foot, much to the disgust of the driver, who muttered strange words in Gaelic'},
